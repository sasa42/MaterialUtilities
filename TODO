o Add (current) Collection as an option for filtering materials to be affected.

o Add "Copy material to others" to Edit mode,
  where the material of the active face is copied to the other selected faces

o OSL library

o (?) Add "Rename Textures" - This will require some rework to fit in 2.8

----------------------------- FIXED ----------------------------------

- Add Add-on properties

- This seems to work since the buid of Blender 2.80 (2019-07-11, Pre RC [RC also works])!!
    CRASH: Assign material for Curves crashes when the curve object has more than one material slot not working!

- FIXED Use material lists for material selection in operator panels
- FIXED: problems with selecting by material not selecting faces for "not active" objects
  when you have multiple objects selected in Edit mode

- FIXED: Fix problems with assigning materials when having multiple objects selected in Edit mode
  It currently assigns to faces of the other objects that aren't selected. ("Polygon ID" conflicts?)

- FIXED: Fix Error with listing materials when there is no selected object
- FIXED: Fix problem with Collections Excluded from the View layer
